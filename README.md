## 📖 Description

> *"When digital security meets educational excellence..."*

**The Challenge:** 🚨 Jayden has a problem. He engages in nefarious or otherwise disreputable behavior on his work computer, and has thus contracted a virus. Jayden's problem is now a problem for this class to solve in the second half of the course.

**Our Mission:** 🎯
- 🐍 Develop a Python application for malware detection and removal
- 🖥️ Work with either a virtual copy of Jayden's hard drive OR create our own controlled infection
- 📊 Track development progress through each class session
- 🎓 Master real-world software development practices

**Learning Objectives:** 📚
This repository serves as your gateway to understanding:
- ✅ **Git & GitHub** - Version control mastery
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated development workflows  
- ✅ **Software Development Lifecycle** - Industry-standard practices
- ✅ **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** - Malware analysis and detection

> 💡 **Note:** Each student will maintain a similar repository for final examination purposes.

## 📋 Progression
In our first class we set up our github accounts and connected vscode to github for source control, we 
set up our coding environment, created a virtual environment to develop our application, and investigated
yara as an initial means of detecting malware. We looked into what yara is, what it does, what sort of
resources it requires, and decided it was a worthwile implementation based on our own research, and the
number and reputation of the number of security community representatives who also use it. Thus, we
started writing code. That code is now present in this repository. By the end of our first class, we had gathered some yara rules, and written a basic application to scan the file system for malware. We're off to a healthy start.


Class #2 of group project.

So we proved that our project is feasible, something within the realm of our skillset and got some rudimentary function from it using python-yara. Now we want to build out some CLI UI functionality. Add a few options to select from, give some informative feedback to our users as the application is running, and look into scanning the actively loaded and running processes. We will also be able to make our yara rules folder much more robust and likely circumvent the Edge browser virus block notifications we received upon initial attempt to grab these rules.

#End of class 2. We did not get very far thanks to surveys etc. We moved some functions from the main app to the utilities.py file, we added some user interaction, we added process scanning, and we had technological difficulties. I am working on those. We also had a fiery discussion on how to help students learn better, I will take that feed back into account and we will start fresh nexet class with making the application more user friendly. I will also bring a laptop and we will reformat it and attempt to infect it with malware.
