# Project Title
CompSci 150 - Intro to programming - Python Malware scanner

## Description
Jayden has a problem. He engages in nefarious or otherwise disreputable behavior on his work computer, and has thus contracted a virus. Jayden's problem is now a problem for this class to solve in the second half of the course. We will develop a python application, and, if we are able to get a virtual copy of Jayden's hard drive, we will attempt to detect that malware and remove it. In the event we are unable to get a copy of his work drive to spin a virtual a machine, we will infect a virtual machine via our own means. This repo will track the progress of the development of that software through each class. Each student will be required to have a simillar repo for final examination. This github repo and interaction with github will help you to develop an understanding of git, github, and CI/CD all of which are central and fundamental to the software development life cycle.
