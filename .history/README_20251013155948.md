## 📖 Description

> *"In the digital battlefield, knowledge is your greatest weapon."*

**The Mission:** Jayden has found himself in quite the predicament! 😱 His questionable browsing habits have led to a compromised work computer, and now it's up to our CompSci 150 class to become digital detectives and solve this cybersecurity crisis.

**What We're Building:**
- 🐍 A powerful Python-based malware detection system
- 🔍 Advanced scanning algorithms to identify threats
- 🧹 Automated removal capabilities for detected malware
- 📊 Comprehensive reporting and analysis tools

**The Challenge:**
We'll be working with either:
- 💾 A virtual copy of Jayden's infected hard drive (if obtainable)
- 🦠 A controlled infection in our own virtual environment

This repository serves as our **mission control center**, documenting every step of our journey from concept to deployment. Through this project, you'll master:
- ✅ Git version control and collaborative development
- ✅ GitHub workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Real-world software development practices
- ✅ Cybersecurity fundamentals and malware analysis
