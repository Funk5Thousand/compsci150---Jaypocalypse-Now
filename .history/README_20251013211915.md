## 📖 Description

> *"When digital security meets educational excellence..."*

**The Challenge:** 🚨 Jayden has a problem. He engages in nefarious or otherwise disreputable behavior on his work computer, and has thus contracted a virus. Jayden's problem is now a problem for this class to solve in the second half of the course.

**Our Mission:** 🎯
- 🐍 Develop a Python application for malware detection and removal
- 🖥️ Work with either a virtual copy of Jayden's hard drive OR create our own controlled infection
- 📊 Track development progress through each class session
- 🎓 Master real-world software development practices

**Learning Objectives:** 📚
This repository serves as your gateway to understanding:
- ✅ **Git & GitHub** - Version control mastery
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated development workflows  
- ✅ **Software Development Lifecycle** - Industry-standard practices
- ✅ **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** - Malware analysis and detection

> 💡 **Note:** Each student will maintain a similar repository for final examination purposes.

## 📋 Table of Contents
In our first class we set up our github accounts and connected vscode to github for source control, we 
set up our coding environment, created a virtual environment to develop our application, and investigated
yara as an initial means of detecting malware. We looked into what yara is, what it does, what sort of
resources it requires, and decided it was a worthwile implementation based on our own research, and the
number and reputation of the number of security community representatives who also use it. Thus, we
started writing code. That code is now present in this repository.
